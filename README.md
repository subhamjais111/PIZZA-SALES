# PIZZA SALES
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data from January to December 2015 to provide actionable insights for improving business performance. Leveraging Power BI, a comprehensive sales dashboard was developed to visualize and interpret key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total orders, average order value, and pizza sales distribution.

The analysis highlights several important trends:

Sales Performance:

Total revenue amounted to $817.86K, driven by 21,350 orders, with 49,574 pizzas sold.
The average order value was $38.31, with an average of 2.32 pizzas per order.
Best and Worst Sellers:

The Thai Chicken pizza contributed the highest revenue, while the Classic Deluxe pizza led in quantity and total orders.
The Brie Carre pizza recorded the lowest performance in revenue, quantity, and orders.
Category and Size Insights:

The "Classic" pizza category accounted for the highest percentage of sales (26.91%).
Large-sized pizzas dominated sales, contributing to 45.89% of total pizzas sold.
Seasonal and Daily Trends:

Sales peaked during weekends, particularly on Friday and Saturday evenings.
The busiest months were July and January, indicating potential seasonal promotions during these periods.
Pizza Sales Breakdown:

A detailed breakdown of sales by category and size, as well as the top and bottom-performing pizzas in terms of revenue, quantity, and orders, was included to guide targeted business strategies.
The dashboard also features daily and monthly trends, category-wise and size-wise distribution, and performance metrics to support real-time decision-making. This project demonstrates expertise in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling, providing a foundation for strategic planning and sales optimization.
